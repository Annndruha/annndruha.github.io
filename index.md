* ### Tutor of microcontrollers programming

    *Initiative Creativity Center of the Youth "FabLab UTMN" (Tyumen, Russia)*

    Tutor for programming microcontrollers and development of high-tech devices for children aged 12-15 years. Project Leader, I read a course on programming in C++, binary logic, and practical applications.

* ### Tutor of C++ and Python programming languages

    *Freelance*

    Assistance to children, high school students, university students and graduates with the development of courses in programming languages, helps with term paper and thesis writing.

* ### Python developer, Deep Learning Engineer

    *Center of Engineering Physics at Lomonosov Moscow State University*

    Working on ‚ÄúEyePoint P10‚Äù - a signature analysis system. EyePoint P10 aims to detect faulty electronic components on printed circuit boards. My respon-sibilities are write Python code, fix bugs, working on architecture and use deep neural networks for electronic components recognition.


* ### Teacher of neural networks courses

    *Faculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University*

    I teach a one-year course on neural networks and machine learning second term students of the Faculty of Physics. The course covers a wide range of neural networks types, deals with solving various problems, and covers such studies-related tools as TensorFlow, Git, Jupiter. In the second part of the course, students do a practice-oriented coursework with teacher assistance.
